# HackBrowserData Extractor


**HackBrowserData Extractor** is a simple python tool to complement [HackBrowserData](https://github.com/moonD4rk/HackBrowserData) by helping extract specific cookies from the output CSV file. It allows you to extract only cookies from a specific host in JSON to import them through the [Cookie Editor](https://cookie-editor.com/) extension. It also allows you to extract directly from a JSON.

> **Why**?
> 
> During a Red Team Assessment, I needed to use HackBrowserData to extract a machine's browser cookies, but its output was just a CSV with all the cookies, so I had to manually copy the cookies and identify the ones that were actually needed. During this time, cookies such as those from Google ended up expiring. 

### Run

With the CSV generated by HackBrowserData:

```
$ python3 HBDExtractor.py <JSON or CSV file> <keyword>
```

> The **keyword** will be used to search for only cookies that contain it in the Domain field.
